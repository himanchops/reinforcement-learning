# reinforcement-learning
Theory and projects implemented using Reinforcement Learning in Python.
The theory of Reinforcement learning is covered in the Jupyter notebook ReLe.ipynb. It covers the following topics:

- The multi-armed bandit problem and the explore-exploit dilemma
- Ways to calculate means and moving averages and their relationship to stochastic gradient descent
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Dynamic Programming
- Monte Carlo
- Temporal Difference (TD) Learning (Q-Learning and SARSA)
- Approximation Methods (i.e. how to plug in a deep neural network or other differentiable model into your RL algorithm)
- How to use OpenAI Gym

Projects included:
- Stock Trading Bot
- Tic Tac Toe
